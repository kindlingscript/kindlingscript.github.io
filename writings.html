          you're humming,<br />
          like a vibration<br />
          welled up inside,<br />
          bursting at my seams.<br /><br />

          hand against my knee,<br />
          mine covering my mouth.<br />
          i can feel your grip,<br />
          as light as this breath<br />
          against my lazy fingers.<br /><br />

          the monitor's cracked, bugs<br />
          inside, outside, destabilizing.<br />
          you shift, laying your head--<br />
          lying to me the same.<br /><br />

          "i don't care, i don't--"<br />
          a grimace, error siren,<br />
          a hammer to the monitor--<br />
          why? you shudder, nothing<br />
          more. you lay down again,<br />
          shivering against me.<br /><br />

          nothing is here to light the room,<br />
          nothing nothing nothing<br />
          you scoop my face up,<br />
          fingers gentle scraping<br />
          and say, softly:<br /><br />

          "it's over."

          the choking, the straining<br />

          it stops.<br />

          within my brain.<br />
          that's it, that's<br />
          the words i know<br />
          so damned well.<br /><br />

          repeating inside, but<br />
          connection's faulty<br />
          from brain to lungs<br />
          to vocalization,<br />
          overcome with<br />
          fraught emotions.<br /><br />

          the world pauses,<br />
          just for moments<br />
          and then, finally,<br />
          it's "full-speed ahead, sir!"<br />
          the clock buckles,<br />

          and i am left to catch up.

          Cracked blood hands, we<br />
          rush throughout days with<br />
          no care to the ones beside,<br />
          and we'll stumble through.<br />
          "Please don't forget,"<br />
          (us, though.)<br /><br />

          Edges melt into blue<br />
          icy startling flakes, and<br />
          puffs of air are our<br />
          only source of heat,<br />
          brought back to us<br />
          by our own gloved<br />
          (still cracked<br />
          underneath)<br />
          hands.<br /><br />

          A freeze brings<br />
          along some isolation;<br />
          it's welcome, though in<br />
          heat and relief within<br />
          these patchy half-sturdy<br />
          walls (if only there were<br />
          some sort of fire.)<br /><br />

          "It'll make its way,<br />
          through here and out,"<br />
          you say, hot breath<br />
          forming, spreading<br />
          out from your lips.<br />
          Trees will give life,<br />
          and the world will<br />
          burst forth again.<br /><br />

          For now, though,<br />
          we keep trudging,<br />
          keys jingling towards<br />
          our warm solace.

          I would; like you<br />
          said. Cover us both,<br />
          and straightedged winds<br />
          wouldn't destroy<br />
          everything.<br /><br />

          The prairie is no place<br />
          for safety, for warmth,<br />
          there's something<br />
          dangerous.<br />
          (Maybe it's you.)<br /><br />

          In the dusk these<br />
          jackrabbits make scarce<br />
          and western meadowlarks<br />
          erase the sky.<br />
          Where do we end?<br /><br />

          Whistling out you pull<br />
          and gunfire echoes<br />
          and I'm crying and you<br />
          keep on going.<br />
          (Am I worse to follow?)<br /><br />

          It's an invocation to<br />
          a flower standing ground,<br />
          and my hand kills it<br />
          just as I murmur, "amen."<br />
          We're both red,<br /><br />

          Red,<br />
            <span class="indent">red,</span><br /><br />

          Red, falling down. Sight<br />
          gone in midwest bull horn<br />
          you're still yelling, though.<br />
          Another crack and you<br />
          go quiet. I know better,<br />
          but not better enough.<br /><br />

          At least the sunset<br />
          is given to me.

          I wish I could say I knew what it all was, but I'm not made to know all the answers to myself. It's a conundrum, I'm the only one inside this body, I'm the one who wakes up every morning, every time looking in the mirror, sometimes just realizing... realizing fully, "This is the shell I possess. My soul got this one out of all the others."<br /><br />

          We're full of ourselves to judge each other by these physical shells of ourselves.<br /><br />

          They're aren't us.<br /><br />

          Not really.<br /><br />

          Some say they can measure the weight of a soul when a person dies, a minuscule amount of weight leaving the body.<br /><br />

          Maybe that's it, maybe it's not.<br /><br />

          All I know is I hope someday our souls can manifest themselves and meet for the first time,<br />
          something they can never do here,<br /><br />

          not here.<br /><br />

          It's all so separate here.<br /><br />

          We can hold each other with these shells,<br />
          make love with our lovers and connect as much as these shells can.<br /><br />

          They cannot go any further.<br /><br />

          Not here.<br /><br />

          What can love be when all physical boundaries disappear?<br /><br />

          (When these shells return to dust, when we are free.)

          with his writings,<br />
          spilling out the whats,<br />

          but leaving out why<br />
          because that -<br />
          that is his.<br /><br />

          as such are his nouns,<br />

          he wheedles words from<br />
          the crevices of everything.<br />
          just so does he coax her,<br />
