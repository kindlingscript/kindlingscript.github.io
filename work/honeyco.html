        <p>My client wanted a landing page redesign for their startup website, as they felt their current one at the time didn't convey what they wanted.</p>
        <p>Using the Sketch app, I used their current logo, hero image, a screenshot of their animated video, and the knowledge of what they do, turning it into this new landing page detailing their mission and what they offer. Content writing in the design is my own (which is why there is a bit of Lorem ipsum for gaps in knowledge). Though this design was purchased, it may not reflect what is currently on their website.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed working on this, as their mission and values are close to my heart, having grown up in a family in which the majority were already middle-aged and elderly by the time I was born. As a child and teenager, I became personally acquainted with my relatives having to be placed in expensive assisted living and nursing homes, so I hope that HoneyCo Homes has a successful future where they can help change this aging process into something better.</p>
