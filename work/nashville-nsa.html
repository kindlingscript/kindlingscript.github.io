        <p>As someone who's stuttered since I was around five years old, this has probably been my most personal, "passion" project so far. I'd known about the Nashville chapter of the National Stuttering Association since 2011, but I'd been busy in university then, and only recently went to my first meetup with them.</p>
        <p>Before the meeting, though, I'd been thinking of projects to build that would further my learning and be of practical use for somebody, or some group. I thought back to the Nashville NSA, and thought they could use more of a web presence, coupled with a group blog. This is some of what's come out of the partnership so far, and more will likely come as time passes.</p>
