# Portfolio Website

A complete redesign implementation process of my old one. For this design overhaul, I removed the cover header image as well as the alternating blue and orange color scheme. Instead, I went for a clean white background and settled on orange for the other main color, as it's one of my favorite colors and it evokes a warm, energetic feeling.

I also changed the fonts, most notably the display headers to Cabin Sketch. The body font is Source Sans Pro.

For the first iteration, I went the "bare bones, old-fashioned" method of coding the site up. In future iterations, I plan to move to using Gulp, Sass, minification, etc.
